# Egg

## What is this?
This is a fork of ToastedOven's Discord bot, Egg, that aims to be a major refactor of the bot. Changes include:
- [ ] Migrating from [Discord.Net](https://github.com/discord-net/Discord.Net) to [DSharpPlus](https://github.com/DSharpPlus/DSharpPlus)
- [ ] Massive refactoring of the code such as: Moving majority of the functionality from Program2.cs to individual classes, removing uneeded dependencies, optimizing old functionality
- [ ] Use some of the new functionality of the Discord API such as, DiscordComponents, and SlashCommands
- [ ] Add functionality from my other bots: Polls, VoiceCommands, BetterTwitterEmbeds

This fork is currently a WIP once I have finished at least step 3 from above, I will make a pull request.
